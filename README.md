# Eat-Da-Burger

This is a restaurant app that lets you add burgers by name (the burger will be added to a column on the right of burgers that are ready to be devoured), eat them with a click of a button (which will move the burger to the right column, listing burgers already devoured), and after they have been devoured you can delete them if you want.
