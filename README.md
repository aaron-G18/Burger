# Eat-Da-Burger

This is a restaurant app that lets you add burgers by name (the burger will be added to a column on the right of burgers that are ready to be devoured), eat them with a click of a button (which will move the burger to the right column, listing burgers already devoured), and after they have been devoured you can delete them if you want.

The main focus of this project was to utilize express, express-handlebars, object-relational mapping (ORM), and mysql to create an app that will create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data in a MySQL database.
